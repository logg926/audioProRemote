# Changelog

### 2.6.19

* `RtpStreamSend.cpp`: Fix a crash in `StorePacket()` when it receives an old packet and there is no space left in the storage buffer (thanks to zkfun for reporting it and providing us with the solution).
* Update deps.

### 2.6.18

* Fix usage of a deallocated `RTC::TcpConnection` instance under heavy CPU usage due to mediasoup deleting the instance in the middle of a receiving iteration.

* Improve build system by using all available CPU cores in parallel.


### 2.6.16

* Don't mandate server port range to be >= 99.


### 2.6.15

* Update deps.


### 2.6.12

* Fix RTCP Receiver Report handling.


### 2.6.11

* Update deps.
* Simulcast: Increase profiles one by one unless explicitly forced (fixes #188).


### 2.6.10

* `PlainRtpTransport.js`: Add missing methods and events.


### 2.6.9

* Remove a potential crash if a single `encoding` is given in the Producer `rtpParameters` and it has a `profile` value.


### 2.6.8

* C++: Verify in libuv static callbacks that the associated C++ instance has not been deallocated (thanks @artushin and @mariat-atg for reporting and providing valuable help in #258).


### 2.6.7

* Fix wrong destruction of Transports in Router.cpp that generates 100% CPU usage in mediasoup-worker processes.


### 2.6.6

* Fix a port leak when a WebRtcTransport is remotely closed due to a DTLS close alert (thanks @artushin for reporting it in #259).


### 2.6.5

* RtpPacket: Fix Two-Byte header extensions parsing.


### 2.6.4

* Upgrade again to OpenSSL 1.1.0j (20 Nov 2018) after adding a workaround for issue [#257](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup/issues/257).


### 2.6.3

* Downgrade OpenSSL to version 1.1.0h (27 Mar 2018) until issue [#257](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup/issues/257) is fixed.


### 2.6.2

* C++: Remove all `Destroy()` class methods and no longer do `delete this`.
* Update libuv to 1.24.1.
* Update OpenSSL to 1.1.0g.


### 2.6.1

* worker: Internal refactor and code cleanup.
* Remove announced support for certain RTCP feedback types that mediasoup does nothing with (and avoid forwarding them to the remote RTP sender).
* fuzzer: fix some wrong memory access in `RtpPacket::Dump()` and `StunMessage::Dump()` (just used during development).

### 2.6.0

* Integrate [libFuzzer](http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) into mediasoup (documentation in the `doc` folder). Extensive testing done. Several heap-buffer-overflow and memory leaks fixed.


### 2.5.6

* `Producer.cpp`: Remove `UpdateRtpParameters()`. It was broken since Consumers
  were not notified about profile removed and so on, so they may crash.
* `Producer.cpp: Remove some maps and simplify streams handling by having a
  single `mapSsrcRtpStreamInfo`. Just keep `mapActiveProfiles` because
  `GetActiveProfiles()` method needs it.
* `Producer::MayNeedNewStream()`: Ignore new media streams with new SSRC if
  its RID is already in use by other media stream (fixes #235).
* Fix a bad memory access when using two byte RTP header extensions.


### 2.5.5

* `Server.js`: If a worker crashes make sure `_latestWorkerIdx` becomes 0.


### 2.5.4

* `server.Room()`: Assign workers incrementally or explicitely via new `workerIdx` argument.
* Add `server.numWorkers` getter.


### 2.5.3

* Don't announce `muxId` nor RTP MID extension support in `Consumer` RTP parameters.


### 2.5.2

* Enable RTP MID extension again.


### 2.5.1

* Disable RTP MID extension until [#230](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup/issues/230) is fixed.


### 2.5.0

* Add RTP MID extension support.

### 2.4.6

* Do not close `Transport` on ICE disconnected (as it would prevent ICE restart on "recv" TCP transports).


### 2.4.5

* Improve codec matching.


### 2.4.4

* Fix audio codec matching when `channels` parameter is not given.


### 2.4.3

* Make `PlainRtpTransport` not leak if port allocation fails (related issue [#224](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup/issues/224)).

### 2.3.2

* `Channel.js`: Upgrade `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` to 20 seconds to avoid timeout errors when the the Node or worker thread usage is too high (related to this [issue](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup-client/issues/48)).


### 2.3.1

* H264: Check if there is room for the indicated NAL unit size (thanks @ggarber).
